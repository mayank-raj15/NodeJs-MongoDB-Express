/-------------How Internet Works?---------------/
-> the domain name is not the real address, so to get the real address, the browser will send a request to the DNS(Domain Name System) which fill find the real IP address of the site and send it back to the browser.
-> the server connects to the user through TCP/IP protocol which are just the rules of how data tranfer would take place
-> the user sends the HTTP request containg the information about what we the user wants
-> the server will create the data to be sent and then a HTTP response will be given back to the user 
-> data transfer takes place in the form of small chunks
